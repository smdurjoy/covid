                            <p>According to the CDC, early information shows that some people are at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html" target="_blank">higher risk</a> of getting very sick from COVID-19. This includes older adults and people of any age who:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Have serious underlying medical conditions,</b> such as heart, lung or liver disease; diabetes; moderate to severe asthma; severe obesity; and renal failure.</li>

                                <li><b>Have a weakened immune system,</b> including those undergoing cancer treatment.</li>

                                <li><b>People who are pregnant</b> should also be monitored since they are known to be at risk with severe viral illness; however, to date data on COVID-19 has not shown increased risk. If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19, it is critical for you to take actions to avoid getting sick.</li>

                                <li><b>Stay home, avoid close contact</b> with others and follow the other steps above.</li>

                                <li><b>Call your health care provider if you have concerns</b>or to ask about obtaining extra necessary medications in case you need to stay home for a prolonged period of time.</li>

                                <li><b>Call a medical professional as soon as COVID-19 symptoms start,</b> if you are at higher risk.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 className="peraGape infoTitle">IF YOU ARE SICK</h3>
                            <p>According to the CDC, COVID-19 symptoms include fever, shortness of breath and a cough. Keep track of your symptoms, which may appear two to 14 days after exposure, and call to seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen, such as difficulty breathing.</p>

                                <li><b>Separate yourself from other people</b>  in your home. On your own, clean and disinfect all surfaces daily and high-touch surfaces frequently throughout the day in your sick room and designated bathroom. Have a healthy household member do the same for surfaces in other parts of the home.</li>

                                <li><b>Wear a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" target="_blank"></a> cloth face cover</b>if you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a health care providerâ€™s office.
